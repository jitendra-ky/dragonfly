# DragonFly Overview

In this project **Dragonfly**, I am developing a fully functional open-source chatting application using industry best practices, which include:

- a highly architectured codebase,
- automated testing of most of the code,
- well-organized documentation,
- industry-standard coding style and formatting,
- structured git-version-control commit history,
- organized issues and PRs with labels.
